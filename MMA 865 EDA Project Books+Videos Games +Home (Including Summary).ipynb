      "The German physician and philosopher Heisenberg counts together with the German Erwin Schrdinger as founder of the Quantum mechanics. In the year 1927 he formulated the uncertainty relation, German: \"Unschrferelation\" (also called indeterminacy principle) according to which place and impulse of a subatomic particle cannot be destined at the same time. For his quantum physical research he received in 1932 the Nobel prize of physics. After the second World War Heisenberg became director of the Max-Planck-Institute. His \"Einheitliche Theorie der Elementarteilchen\" (unitary theory of elementary particles) from the year 1958 was called \"world formula\" (although that is just what it is not!) and strengthened Heisenbergs position as one of the most important representative of quantum physics. In countless lectures and essays he disputed the philosophical implications of quantum physics, among others in \"Quantentheorie und Philosophie\", \"Physik und Philosophie\" and \"Der Teil und das Ganze\". According to Heisenberg the whole thing is more than the summary of the parts. In this idealism is recognizable as to such a degree that it must be concluded to have created not the theory but vice versa the reality itself. And this would mean, that in the end all things that came into being must be traced back to an immaterial flow of information. But information is a spiritual phenomeneon. The magazine \"Der SPIEGEL\" called this \"God in the quantum chaos\", for according to Heisenberg: \"The quantum theory leaves no room for a totally objective description of nature... In the experiments of atomic procedures we have to do with material things and facts, with phenomenons so much real as any phenomenon in daily life. But the atoms or the elementary particles are not equally real. They form much more a world of tendencies and possibilities than a world of things and facts.\" Quite a heap of idealism, it seems, but a compelling conclusion from the datum of physics? Does a spiritual principle stick behind the whole cake? The universe as quantum world! A world which is incessantly in movement because she is designed like that. Only by movement is the personality-structure of all proprieties held. Still-stand is death, or better: non-existence. Is there still-stand at all? Nowhere is it visible, nowhere it has space. Einstein struggled long against the quantum theory. He tried to adopt it to the theoretical fundament of the classic physics and confessed to himself that he failed. There is no solid - you could also say no material - ground on which the order of the world is built! Many years Einstein spent to give the world the knowledge, that there is no chance to pass by the quantum theory, an almost metaphysical theory, when describing reality. In reference to Einstein`s theory of relativity Heisenberg had called the fact that all physical systems possess either the propriety of a wave or of a particle and that only one of the two is measurable, \"indeterminacy principle\" or \"uncertainty relation\". Material, according to Einstein nothing but of time and energy, was robbed of it`s last consistency. Und such thing should have stood in the beginning of the universe? Impossible since the quantum mechanics stand before. Material needs an idea to start movement. A frontier crossing to the spiritual realm is inevitable! Interestingly Heisenberg perceived the contradiction of the quantum theory to modern biology. \"...most biologists are prepared to confess, that the existence of atoms and molecules can only be understood with the help of the quantum theory, but besides that they have the wish to regard the working material of the chemists and biologists, namely atoms and molecules, as stuff of classic physics, thus dealing with them as with stones or grain of sand.\" Creation is, by all appearance, provided that we are ready to believe the quantum physics an artfully, a subtle construction, a \"Within\" which does not only make an \"Outside\" thinkable but even demands for it. Any attempt of a world formula\" in the sense of Einstein must therefore fail, because it wants to explain the Within without the Outside! Some may flinch from the title of the book or the name of the author to read the book. The fears are not grounded. Basic knowledge of atomic physics is sufficient to understand what the author is talking about. He uses a clear and simple diction. If one understands his theories is another matter. But this might be indebted to the ideology one tends to hold.\n",

      "I consider this one of the critical few books to read if recovering from abuse or if someone you care for is. By now the book may be a tiny bit dated due to new insights about healing and memory, but it retains its value. There is good advice for dealing with difficult relationships and for recovering from trauma of any type. It's compassionate and common-sensible, without being preachy, whiny, sensationalistic, formulaic or judgmental as so many self-help books can be. The techniques for coming to terms with any kind of abuse can be applied in many situations. It's sort of a life manual in fact and I highly recommend it.\n",

      "I had this book sitting on my wish list forever. Every time I needed a new book, I always skipped over this. Well, finally I decided to get it out from the library so I'd be forced to read it...and I'm soooo glad I did. This book was IMPOSSIBLE to put down. It came everywhere with me until I finished it. The book offers three different view points from three very different women. In the beginning, these women are strangers to one another, but over time we see how they each come into each others lives, and how much they (and the reader) are affected by this. Karen has been on death-row in Texas for 5 years for killing multiple men. She gives us a glimpse as to what the prison life is like, and the odd friendships that are formed. Franny is a doctor in NYC who's life is falling apart. After receiving news of her Uncle's death, she leaves her old life behind to go home to her native Texas. There she starts a most unexpected job, and a most unexpected relationship with a death-row inmate. And finally, Celia is the wife of one of Karens victims. We hear her heartbreaking story of life without her husband, her range of emotions towards Karen, and how she copes with it all in the end. I can't recommend this book enough. These women become women we know, and care about. And even though Karen has killed numerous men, (and we hear how this has effected one of their wives) you can't help but feel sorry for her. I've added Ms. Ward's newest novel 'How To Be Lost' to my wish list, and definitely won't wait so long to read it.\n",

The use of colour is wonderful. We also co-sleep, so it's great to finally find a book without a baby in a crib - an image she won't know.

      "Paul Bede Johnson (born 1928) is an English journalist, popular historian, and author; he has also written books such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/A-History-of-Christianity/dp/1441746714/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A History of Christianity</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Intellectuals/dp/B001N4PY9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Intellectuals</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Modern-Times-Revised-Edition-The-World-from-the-Twenties-to-the-Nineties-Perennial-Classics/dp/0060935502/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Modern Times  Revised Edition: The World from the Twenties to the Nineties (Perennial Classics)</a>. He wrote in the Prologue to this 1987 book, \"While I was working on my 'History of Christianity,' I became aware for the first time in my life of the magnitude of the debt Christianity owes to Judaism... Christianity ... (continued) much of the moral and dogmatic theology, the liturgy, the institutions and the fundamental concepts of its forebear. I thereupon determined... to write about the people who had given birth to my faith, to explore their history back to its origins and forward to the present day, and to make up my own mind about their role and significance.\" He notes early on that the Jewish people are \"the only people in the world today who possess a historical record ... which allows them to trace their origins back into very remote times.\" (Pg. 7) About the biblical accounts, he observes, \"Still more remarkable is the attention devoted to women, the leading role they often play, their vivacity and power.\" (Pg. 15) Later, he adds, \"Equally important, was another characteristic of Judaism: the relative absence of dogmatic theology.\" (Pg. 161) He suggests that the Jewish people \"were quick to respond to entirely new phenomena and situations. Their religion taught them to rationalize... (The Jewish peole) had no share in or emotional commitment to society as a whole and so could watch its old traditions, methods and institutions being demolished without a pang.\" (Pg. 247) But he suggests that in America, \"Since all religious groups had virtually equal rights, there was no point in any constituting itself into a separate community... Hence from the start, (they) were not organized in communal but on congregational lines, like other churches.\" (Pg. 280)  After the Enlightenment, he laments, \"Reform (Judaism) waited in vain for a Luther. The best it could produce was Rabbi Abraham Geiger.\" (Pg. 333) He notes in conclusion, \"the historian must always bear in mind that Judaism has always been greater than the sum of its adherents. Judaism created the (Jewish people), not the other way around.\" (Pg. 582) Although written by a Christian, this sympathetic one-volume history is a very interesting and thought-provoking book for everyone interested in religious history.\n",

      "It took me a while to get through, but this book was really, really good. It was, perhaps, one of the better written, more psychologically perceptive novels that I've read.  The way Lessing builds the character of Martha Quest is as close to perfect as I've ever read.  Martha is annoying.  It's pretty hard to like her at all.  You don't really sympathize with what she does or her motivations, since she's pretty clearly an impulsive idiot kid.  Nonetheless, it's impossible not to believe what she does or see her actions as extremely genuine.  There are no simple stereotypes here.  I've called her an impulsive kid, and that's what she is, but I don't want to oversimplify.  Just like any impulsive kid, she doesn't always do what you expect.  She's not stupid, and doesn't always make the wrong decisions.  She is 100% herself, and even 60 years after the book was written, she feels fresh and new.\n",

A 5.5 pound chicken fitted snuggly inside without a problem. Chicken stayed moist and nice. I will be using for my Thanksgiving turkey breast. (Easy recipe for that). Amazingly easy to clean. Most came off right away and the rest with a little soaking. Hardly any scrubbing needed. (They do not recommend using in a dishwasher, but there really is no need.) Price is certainly right in comparison to other Dutch ovens of this type. Cautions: it does cook faster than stainless steel or other Dutch ovens - so reduce your cooking time. I almost burnt some of the chicken even though I reduced my time. It can go on the stove top but not for high heat - i.e. no frying or high heat for braising. I plan on getting a smaller one for every day use because there are just two of us and I do not need this large of a pot for small stews. I am also contemplating a skillet.\n",

      "I bought mine through Miele and had them install it, which extends the warranty by 2 years. Mine is connected to my R/O water system, and that was not a problem for their installer. I have two other machines, both DeLonghis, and the Miele makes better coffee and espresso, is quieter, easier to maintain (yes, even with cleaning the milk pipe work, which is not difficult), far easier to clean and much more reliable. The reason I have two DeLonghis is because one or the other was always in the shop. The price of this Miele is comparable to the DeLonghi Gran Dama, but this is a better machine (though the Gran Dama is fine in my greenhouse). If you are having cabinetry built for this unit, be sure there is no inner lip on your cabinet; otherwise some kludging will have to be done for a good fit (been there, done that). And if you are looking to spend a lot on a coffee machine, this is definitely one to think about getting.\n",

      "The German physician and philosopher Heisenberg counts together with the German Erwin Schrdinger as founder of the Quantum mechanics. In the year 1927 he formulated the uncertainty relation, German: \"Unschrferelation\" (also called indeterminacy principle) according to which place and impulse of a subatomic particle cannot be destined at the same time. For his quantum physical research he received in 1932 the Nobel prize of physics. After the second World War Heisenberg became director of the Max-Planck-Institute. His \"Einheitliche Theorie der Elementarteilchen\" (unitary theory of elementary particles) from the year 1958 was called \"world formula\" (although that is just what it is not!) and strengthened Heisenbergs position as one of the most important representative of quantum physics. In countless lectures and essays he disputed the philosophical implications of quantum physics, among others in \"Quantentheorie und Philosophie\", \"Physik und Philosophie\" and \"Der Teil und das Ganze\". According to Heisenberg the whole thing is more than the summary of the parts. In this idealism is recognizable as to such a degree that it must be concluded to have created not the theory but vice versa the reality itself. And this would mean, that in the end all things that came into being must be traced back to an immaterial flow of information. But information is a spiritual phenomeneon. The magazine \"Der SPIEGEL\" called this \"God in the quantum chaos\", for according to Heisenberg: \"The quantum theory leaves no room for a totally objective description of nature... In the experiments of atomic procedures we have to do with material things and facts, with phenomenons so much real as any phenomenon in daily life. But the atoms or the elementary particles are not equally real. They form much more a world of tendencies and possibilities than a world of things and facts.\" Quite a heap of idealism, it seems, but a compelling conclusion from the datum of physics? Does a spiritual principle stick behind the whole cake? The universe as quantum world! A world which is incessantly in movement because she is designed like that. Only by movement is the personality-structure of all proprieties held. Still-stand is death, or better: non-existence. Is there still-stand at all? Nowhere is it visible, nowhere it has space. Einstein struggled long against the quantum theory. He tried to adopt it to the theoretical fundament of the classic physics and confessed to himself that he failed. There is no solid - you could also say no material - ground on which the order of the world is built! Many years Einstein spent to give the world the knowledge, that there is no chance to pass by the quantum theory, an almost metaphysical theory, when describing reality. In reference to Einstein`s theory of relativity Heisenberg had called the fact that all physical systems possess either the propriety of a wave or of a particle and that only one of the two is measurable, \"indeterminacy principle\" or \"uncertainty relation\". Material, according to Einstein nothing but of time and energy, was robbed of it`s last consistency. Und such thing should have stood in the beginning of the universe? Impossible since the quantum mechanics stand before. Material needs an idea to start movement. A frontier crossing to the spiritual realm is inevitable! Interestingly Heisenberg perceived the contradiction of the quantum theory to modern biology. \"...most biologists are prepared to confess, that the existence of atoms and molecules can only be understood with the help of the quantum theory, but besides that they have the wish to regard the working material of the chemists and biologists, namely atoms and molecules, as stuff of classic physics, thus dealing with them as with stones or grain of sand.\" Creation is, by all appearance, provided that we are ready to believe the quantum physics an artfully, a subtle construction, a \"Within\" which does not only make an \"Outside\" thinkable but even demands for it. Any attempt of a world formula\" in the sense of Einstein must therefore fail, because it wants to explain the Within without the Outside! Some may flinch from the title of the book or the name of the author to read the book. The fears are not grounded. Basic knowledge of atomic physics is sufficient to understand what the author is talking about. He uses a clear and simple diction. If one understands his theories is another matter. But this might be indebted to the ideology one tends to hold.\n",

DS4 & USB Bluetooth adapter connectivity strength was terrible. It just lagged to much & disconnected. I only tried 2 BT adapters & that was enough for me. A integrated PC Bluetooth & a external USB BT adapter. Both were terrible for DS4/PS4. This adapter by Mayflash , i experienced no lag at all whatsoever. I am using this from 15 feet away & the response time feels like it is wired to the PC. I would rate this 10 stars if i could.

      "I consider this one of the critical few books to read if recovering from abuse or if someone you care for is. By now the book may be a tiny bit dated due to new insights about healing and memory, but it retains its value. There is good advice for dealing with difficult relationships and for recovering from trauma of any type. It is compassionate and common-sensible, without being preachy, whiny, sensationalistic, formulaic or judgmental as so many self-help books can be. The techniques for coming to terms with any kind of abuse can be applied in many situations. It is sort of a life manual in fact and I highly recommend it.\n",

      "I had this book sitting on my wish list forever. Every time I needed a new book, I always skipped over this. Well, finally I decided to get it out from the library so I would be forced to read it...and I am soooo glad I did. This book was IMPOSSIBLE to put down. It came everywhere with me until I finished it. The book offers three different view points from three very different women. In the beginning, these women are strangers to one another, but over time we see how they each come into each others lives, and how much they (and the reader) are affected by this. Karen has been on death-row in Texas for 5 years for killing multiple men. She gives us a glimpse as to what the prison life is like, and the odd friendships that are formed. Franny is a doctor in NYC who is life is falling apart. After receiving news of her Uncle is death, she leaves her old life behind to go home to her native Texas. There she starts a most unexpected job, and a most unexpected relationship with a death-row inmate. And finally, Celia is the wife of one of Karens victims. We hear her heartbreaking story of life without her husband, her range of emotions towards Karen, and how she copes with it all in the end. I cannot recommend this book enough. These women become women we know, and care about. And even though Karen has killed numerous men, (and we hear how this has effected one of their wives) you cannot help but feel sorry for her. I have added Ms. Ward is newest novel 'How To Be Lost' to my wish list, and definitely will not wait so long to read it.\n",

The use of colour is wonderful. We also co-sleep, so it is great to finally find a book without a baby in a crib - an image she will not know.

      "Paul Bede Johnson (born 1928) is an English journalist, popular historian, and author; he has also written books such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/A-History-of-Christianity/dp/1441746714/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A History of Christianity</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Intellectuals/dp/B001N4PY9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Intellectuals</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Modern-Times-Revised-Edition-The-World-from-the-Twenties-to-the-Nineties-Perennial-Classics/dp/0060935502/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Modern Times  Revised Edition: The World from the Twenties to the Nineties (Perennial Classics)</a>. He wrote in the Prologue to this 1987 book, \"While I was working on my 'History of Christianity,' I became aware for the first time in my life of the magnitude of the debt Christianity owes to Judaism... Christianity ... (continued) much of the moral and dogmatic theology, the liturgy, the institutions and the fundamental concepts of its forebear. I thereupon determined... to write about the people who had given birth to my faith, to explore their history back to its origins and forward to the present day, and to make up my own mind about their role and significance.\" He notes early on that the Jewish people are \"the only people in the world today who possess a historical record ... which allows them to trace their origins back into very remote times.\" (Pg. 7) About the biblical accounts, he observes, \"Still more remarkable is the attention devoted to women, the leading role they often play, their vivacity and power.\" (Pg. 15) Later, he adds, \"Equally important, was another characteristic of Judaism: the relative absence of dogmatic theology.\" (Pg. 161) He suggests that the Jewish people \"were quick to respond to entirely new phenomena and situations. Their religion taught them to rationalize... (The Jewish peole) had no share in or emotional commitment to society as a whole and so could watch its old traditions, methods and institutions being demolished without a pang.\" (Pg. 247) But he suggests that in America, \"Since all religious groups had virtually equal rights, there was no point in any constituting itself into a separate community... Hence from the start, (they) were not organized in communal but on congregational lines, like other churches.\" (Pg. 280)  After the Enlightenment, he laments, \"Reform (Judaism) waited in vain for a Luther. The best it could produce was Rabbi Abraham Geiger.\" (Pg. 333) He notes in conclusion, \"the historian must always bear in mind that Judaism has always been greater than the sum of its adherents. Judaism created the (Jewish people), not the other way around.\" (Pg. 582) Although written by a Christian, this sympathetic one-volume history is a very interesting and thought-provoking book for everyone interested in religious history.\n",

      "It took me a while to get through, but this book was really, really good. It was, perhaps, one of the better written, more psychologically perceptive novels that I have read.  The way Lessing builds the character of Martha Quest is as close to perfect as I have ever read.  Martha is annoying.  It is pretty hard to like her at all.  You do not really sympathize with what she does or her motivations, since she is pretty clearly an impulsive idiot kid.  Nonetheless, it is impossible not to believe what she does or see her actions as extremely genuine.  There are no simple stereotypes here.  I have called her an impulsive kid, and that is what she is, but I do not want to oversimplify.  Just like any impulsive kid, she does not always do what you expect.  She is not stupid, and does not always make the wrong decisions.  She is 100% herself, and even 60 years after the book was written, she feels fresh and new.\n",

      "Lovely appearance, works very well. First use - whole chicken in milk (with cinnamon, lemon rind and garlic !). Recipe was not as great as touted but the oven worked beautifully. A 5.5 pound chicken fitted snuggly inside without a problem. Chicken stayed moist and nice. I will be using for my Thanksgiving turkey breast. (Easy recipe for that). Amazingly easy to clean. Most came off right away and the rest with a little soaking. Hardly any scrubbing needed. (They do not recommend using in a dishwasher, but there really is no need.) Price is certainly right in comparison to other Dutch ovens of this type. Cautions: it does cook faster than stainless steel or other Dutch ovens - so reduce your cooking time. I almost burnt some of the chicken even though I reduced my time. It can go on the stove top but not for high heat - i.e. no frying or high heat for braising.

The sage green color I ordered is really true to color.  However, as another reviewer mentioned, it does snag easily due to the more open weave which is why I gave it four instead of five stars.  When I opened the plastic bag my bracelet immediately snagged at the clasp but it really did not pull the fabric badly and I was able to pull the snag back in place so it really is not noticeable. I washed the blanket before putting it on the bed and it did not shrink at all and washed well.  I really like the fact that it is soft and not stiff like another blanket I bought recently.\n",

The use of Daniel Waterhouse as a narator to the thoughts and actions of Newton, Liebniz, and the beginning of the Royal Society is wonderful.  I highly recommend all three books in this series as must reading.  Despite the size of the undertaking, it is a fantastic history of London and the predominant thoughts of the 16th and early 17th centuries.\n",

I have always found that the more vaguely the character is described, the easier it is for me to, 'cast' the 'players' in my own mental theater.  All reading is, of course, to varying degrees, 'Theatre of the Mind', and your own miraculous mind supplies everything the story wuth all but the 'Grand Drapery', to sweep your mental stage and open the show.\",\n",

Each tea profile features a brief description of the provenance, appearance, color, smell and taste along with specific brewing instructions. Unlike similar books, this author provides the recommended brewing practices for both Western and Gongfu styles and alerts the reader to cases in which the Gongfu is prefered. The more technical terminology describing tastes, colors, and characteristics etc. used throughout the book are defined in a handy glossary at the end of the book.'],\n",
